Our project about pong game. Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade video game, 
featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and 
originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created 
by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell,
but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's 
work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic
ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response,
Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to establish the video game 
industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing 
games that closely mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new types of video 
games that deviated from Pong's original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari 
to encourage its staff to move beyond Pong and produce more innovative games themselves.
